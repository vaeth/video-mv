A frontend for using mplayer and mencoder as a video recorder.

The POSIX script video/videoencode is a wrapper for mplayer/mencoder
to record from TV (typically with high redundancy) or
to improve the encoding (in possibly several passes), respectively.

In addition there are the scripts sleepto and videorecord which can help you
to start the video script at an appropriate time.

To install these scripts simply copy the content of bin into your PATH
and the content of etc into /etc or also into your PATH.
The latter is supposed to be modified to the defaults which you want
(e.g. matching your hardware).

You also need push.sh from http://github.com/vaeth/push in your path.
If you want that the hard status line is set, also the title script from
http://github.com/vaeth/runtitle (version >=2.0) is required in your path.

To get help run in a shell
	video -\?  (-h is reserved for "hue")
	videoencode -h
	videorecord -h
	sleepto -h

For Gentoo, there is an ebuild in the mv overlay (available by layman).
