A frontend for using mplayer and mencoder as a video recorder.

This POSIX script is a wrapper for mplayer (video) and mencoder (videoencode)
to record from TV (typically with high redundancy) or
to improve the encoding (in possibly several passes), respectively.

To install these scripts simply copy the content of bin into your PATH
and the content of etc into /etc or also into your PATH.
The latter is supposed to be modified to the defaults which you want.

To get help run in a shell
	video -\?
	videoencode -\?

For Gentoo, there is an ebuild in the mv overlay (available by layman).
